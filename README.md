Hi There,

I couldn't find any bootstrap script for code deploy agent installation.. So, I have provided this user-data script that is region agnostic and works on ubuntu/rhel/amz/centos.

Usage
1-) Copy user-data.sh and paste on you aws instance userdata field.

peace

Please feel free to enhance the script.

Felipe A.
